# NimNode [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tulayang/nimnode.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tulayang/nimnode)

Library for async programming and communication. This Library uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model based on libuv, and provides future/promise which aims to facilitate asynchronous programming. **[API Documentation](https://tulayang.github.io/node)**
